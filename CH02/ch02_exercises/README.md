#Exercises

## Exercise 1
Write a function that takes as a parameter a list of integers as a string (eg `['1', '2', '3']` ) and which displays for each number whether it is even or odd.

Example:
>>> pair_impair(['1', '2', '3'])
impair
pair
impair

## Exercise 2
Using `len`, `range` eand slicing, write a `for` loop that displays all sequences of 3 consecutive items from the list `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`.

Example:

    [1, 2, 3]
    [2, 3, 4]
    [3, 4, 5]
    [4, 5, 6]
    [5, 6, 7]
    [6, 7, 8]
    [7, 8, 9]

Please place your code in `ch02_ex2.py`

## Exercise 3
Create a function `maj_inverser` that takes a string and returns the same string, but in uppercase and inverted.

Please place your code in `ch02_ex3.py`

### Exercise 4
Write the function count_letters which takes as a parameter a string of characters and which returns a dictionary such that for each pair the key is a letter and the value is its number of occurrences in the string.

Example of use:

    >>> compter_lettres('mississippi')
    {'s': 4, 'm': 1, 'i': 4, 'p': 2}

Please place your code in `ch02_ex4.py`
